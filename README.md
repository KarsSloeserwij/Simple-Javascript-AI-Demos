# Simple-Javascript-AI-Demos
2 simple javascript demos of q-table based reinforcement learning. One a simple jumper that learns to jump over blocks, the other is tic-tac-toe. The Tic-Tac-Toe version displays the win and tie percantage for each player with ChartJS


# How to use:
You can find the files in the repective folders.
Both are simple HTML files and should be easy enough to use.

Note: Both require JQuery. So if you want to demo it then download a JQuery version(I used 3.3.1). And edit the import on one of the first lines in the file.
